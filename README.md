# Language-translation
This project is a multilingual text translation tool that demonstrates two methods for translating text between languages. The first method utilizes the Hugging Face MarianMT model, a neural machine translation system from Helsinki-NLP, implemented using the transformers library. This approach involves tokenizing the input text, generating translations with pre-trained models, and decoding the results for accurate translations. The second method employs the Google Translate API via the googletrans library, providing fast and reliable translations using Google's robust translation service. Users can input a sentence, specify the source and target languages, and compare translation outputs from both methods, showcasing the capabilities of modern translation technologies
